## Research Experience
`Jan 2021 - Present` **Dynamic modelling of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immune response and vaccine protection**
+ \- PhD project, collaborated with Zhengqing Zhou and supervised by Prof. Fangting Li
+ \- Based on immunology, nonlinear dynamics and  clinical data analysis, we established a dynamic model of COVID-19 infection and immune response.
+ \- The model can simulate and predict the disease progression of different patients.
+ \- A quantitative index (__immune efficacy $\epsilon$__) for comprehensive __evaluation of immunity__ were proposed.
+ \- A method for __predicting vaccine efficacy__ were proposed, which may help accelerate vaccine research and assist doctors in carrying out personalized treatment.

`Sep 2018 - Feb 2022` **Roles of ATP and hydrolysis free energy ($\Delta G$) in cellular signal transduction**
+ \- PhD project, supervised by Prof. Fangting Li
+ \- A dynamic model of calcium signal transduction in pancreatic β cells was constructed to analyze the nonlinear effect of ATP hydrolysis free energy on insulin release process.
+ \- Relation between network structures and critical roles of ATP/$\Delta G$ in yeast cell cycle regulation network.

`Jan 2019 - Jun 2022` **An efficient and low-cost method to monitor cellular PHA contents**
+ \- Collaborated with Dr. Xu Liu and supervised by Prof. Guo-Qiang Chen.
+ \- A fast, efficient, and low-cost real-time monitoring method for the content of intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) was proposed, which can help optimize PHA production strategies and reduce production costs.
